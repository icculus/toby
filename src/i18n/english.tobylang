/*
 * This text written by Ryan C. Gordon.
 *
 * If you are translating to a new language, do this:
 *
 *  1. Ask yourself, "Do I have a good enough grasp of Toby to understand this
 *     file, and what its purpose is? Do I have sufficient translating skills?
 *     Do I have the ethics to NOT put naughty words that the Toby maintainers
 *     will not understand in here?" If you answered "no" to any of these
 *     questions, stop now.
 *  2. Change the "This text written by" line above to contain your
 *     name. DO NOT CHANGE THE COPYRIGHT. You will be given credit for your
 *     work, but by submitting your work, the maintainers of Toby gain
 *     sole ownership of it. If you don't like that, stop now.
 *  3. E-mail your completed work to Ryan at icculus@clutteredmind.org. He'll
 *     incorporate it into the next release of Toby.
 *  4. C++ comments are acceptable, both in the multiline and "//" form. They
 *     are ignored when this file is parsed. Lines with nothing but whitespace
 *     are also ignored.
 *  5. Only translate the text after the comma in a TOBYI18N section. That is,
 *     in a line that reads: 'TOBYI18N(TOBYI18N_MENUNAME_FILE, "File")'
 *     You would translate "File", and not TOBYI18N nor TOBYI18N_MENUNAME_FILE.
 *  6. Things in quotes follow C++ literal string standards. If you wanted
 *     to have a string with a quotation mark in it, you'd have to write it
 *     like this:  TOBYI18N(MYSTR, "He said, \"hello.\"")
 *  7. Please refer to docs/subsystems/i18n.txt in the source distribution
 *     if you're curious about how this works under the hood or why we did
 *     this like we did.
 *  8. Sometimes strings need dynamic content. For example, there might be
 *     a string that needs to convey, "error in "MyFunction" on line 15.",
 *     to accomodate this, such strings would have "%0" and "%1", with
 *     a description of what each represents. You may move the tokens to
 *     whatever order they need to be in; %1 can come before %0 if your
 *     language requires this, so long as all of those replacing tokens
 *     continue to exist somewhere in the translated string.
 *  9. Please try out your translation in the program to make sure that the
 *     program parses the langfile correctly, and that everything looks good.
 * 10. Expect to be notified if we have more translating work for you
 *     in the future.  :)
 * 11. Questions about context of strings and other concerns can be addressed
 *     to icculus@clutteredmind.org. Please understand that I only speak English,
 *     and even that poorly.  :)
 *
 *                                   Have fun,
 *                                      --ryan.
