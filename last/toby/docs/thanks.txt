At this point, TOBY has been entirely written, and maintained by
 Ryan C. Gordon (icculus@lokigames.com), but in the spirit of the GNU
 project, the software is placed under GNU General Public License, and hopes
 to see more contributors in the future. At such a time, this file will list
 more names. :)  In the meantime...

...Ryan would like to give a shout out to the following:

- Gregory S. Read, for testing Toby's limits, breaking the ELSEIF statement,
  and being a bizarre sort of soul mate. Get yer slack on.
- Sabrina Blanks, April Andrews, and Nicki Publick for being unwitting test
  subjects for Toby.
- Loren Osborne, for many hours of debate and discussion of implementation.
- Michael Roessler, who managed to sleep through the noise of my clicky
  keyboard on many consecutive nights of hacking.
- The journal list gang, for listening to Ryan ramble about his life.
- Robert Spidle, for battling ninjas.
- The "Dragon book" for parsing concepts. Friggin' trees, man.
- Mr. Mullen and Mrs. Kelly, for putting me up to the original project.
- Karie Publick, for the naming the program, in a roundabout way.
- Mrs. Strohm, for many things I never knew I'd be thanking her for later.
- YOUcentric, for proof that Java doesn't necessarily suck.
- Bernd Kreimeier, for thoughts on efficiency of the instanceof operator.
- linux.com, for being my OTHER creative outlet.
- Ani Difranco, Phish, Soul Coughing, Soul Miner's Daughter, Beastie Boys,
  AMG, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers for providing the Soundtrack for da Hack.
- Loki Entertainment Software, for paying my bills.
- The Freshmeat crew, for cutting my appindex entry by about 18 sentences.
- ...and 'A' through 'F' in the phone book.

--ryan.
