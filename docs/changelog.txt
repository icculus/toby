(Stuff before this wasn't worth mentioning...got platform-specific code in
there, ported initial TurtleSpace and util stuff, hacked Makefile and a
standalone program for initial testing.)

05052001 - Plugged in turtle coordinate calculating code in Turtle.cpp.
           Got turtle rendering in GTKTurtleSpaceRenderer. Added gdk_flush()
           calls to GTKTurtleSpaceRenderer, so it syncs up with the X server
           and doesn't hog the processor. Added -lm to the linker line.

05072001 - Filled in offscreen rendering API, for page flipping/bitblt'ing
           of entire screen at once. This should facilitate using Toby for
           animation. FrameBufferTurtleSpaceRenderer hasn't filled in this
           API, which means that for now, only GTKTurtleSpaceRenderer works.
           The FrameBuffer renderer needs a rewrite anyhow. Little tweaks to
           the GTK renderer. Modified standalone.cpp to test offscreen
           rendering. Started initial Tokenizer implementation. Feeling
           intimidated. Added some debugging output to Reader subclasses.
           Changed some internal structure names.
