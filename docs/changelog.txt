(Stuff before this wasn't worth mentioning...got platform-specific code in
there, ported initial TurtleSpace and util stuff, hacked Makefile and a
standalone program for initial testing.)

05052001 - Plugged in turtle coordinate calculating code in Turtle.cpp.
            Got turtle rendering in GTKTurtleSpaceRenderer. Added gdk_flush()
            calls to GTKTurtleSpaceRenderer, so it syncs up with the X server
            and doesn't hog the processor. Added -lm to the linker line.

05072001 - Filled in offscreen rendering API, for page flipping/bitblt'ing
            of entire screen at once. This should facilitate using Toby for
            animation. FrameBufferTurtleSpaceRenderer hasn't filled in this
            API, which means that for now, only GTKTurtleSpaceRenderer works.
            The FrameBuffer renderer needs a rewrite anyhow. Little tweaks to
            the GTK renderer. Modified standalone.cpp to test offscreen
            rendering. Started initial Tokenizer implementation. Feeling
            intimidated. Added some debugging output to Reader subclasses.
            Changed some internal structure names.

05252001 - Added programs/birthday.toby.

07242001 - Added TobyLoader module and Unix/Null implementations.

07262001 - Fixed some comments in the platform/clocks tree. Wrote up
           documentation for my wacky new i18n scheme. Renamed src/localization
           to src/i18n. Committed a buttload of stuff to CVS, which is now
           publically hosted at icculus.org.

07272001 - Rewrote the tobylang files for the new format, and put together
            util/TobyLanguage.h and util/TobyLanguage.cpp for the new format.
            Naturally, this breaks everything.  :)
