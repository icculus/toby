At this point, TOBY has been entirely written, and maintained by
 Ryan C. Gordon (icculus@icculus.org), but in the spirit of the GNU
 project, the software is placed under GNU General Public License, and hopes
 to see more contributors in the future. At such a time, this file will list
 more names. :)  In the meantime...

...Ryan would like to give a shout out to the following:

- The crew at PUC-Rio for Lua, which is basically what I would have created
  for the Toby rewrite if I were to sit down a "do it right."  Thanks for
  saving me more than a few years. Probably about 75% of the problems I needed
  to solve were solved by Lua.
- The crew at wxWidgets.org, who solved probably the other 25%.


(Thanks from older versions...)

- Gregory S. Read, for testing Toby's limits, breaking the ELSEIF statement,
  and being a bizarre sort of soul mate. Get yer slack on.
- Sabrina Blanks, April Andrews, and Nicki Publick for being unwitting test
  subjects for Toby.
- Loren Osborn, for many hours of debate and discussion of implementation.
- Michael Roessler, who managed to sleep through the noise of my clicky
  keyboard on many consecutive nights of hacking.
- The journal list gang, for listening to Ryan ramble about his life.
- Bruce Perens, since ElectricFence has helped to preserve my sanity.
- Robert Spidle, for battling ninjas.
- The "Dragon book" for parsing concepts. Friggin' trees, man.
- Mr. Mullen and Mrs. Kelly, for putting me up to the original project.
- Karie Publick, for the naming the program, in a roundabout way.
- Mrs. Strohm, for many things I never knew I'd be thanking her for later.
- YOUcentric, for proof that Java doesn't necessarily suck.
- Sun Microsystems, for all the effort to disprove YOUcentric.
- Bernd Kreimeier, for thoughts on efficiency of the instanceof operator.
- Ani Difranco, Phish, Soul Coughing, Soul Miner's Daughter, Beastie Boys,
  AMG, Belle and Sebastian, and Tool for providing the Soundtrack for da Hack.
- The Freshmeat crew, for cutting my appindex entry by about 18 sentences.
- ...and 'A' through 'F' in the phone book.

--ryan.
