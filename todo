// Things still to be done for TOBY...

ongoing bugfixes :
    Make global parsing just dump every non-blank line that doesn't start
     with KEYWORD_BEGINFUNC to an array. Until we hit a KEYWORD_BEGINFUNC
     line. Don't even check for syntax. Parse this array at runtime before
     the mainline, and use dealWithVariableDeclaration() on each line. If
     this function ever returns (false) at that time, throw an error.

    Graphics2D does antialiasing?
    Make inputarea use sane keys...
    Unify error displaying interface between parsing and running...
    Functions can specify a return type and then return nothing.
