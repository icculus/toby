This is the original version of Toby. It was written for a senior high-school
exit project over the first couple months of 1995.

I wrote in C, with very little understanding of the language; I was a
QuickBASIC 4.5 fan at the time. This is a CRAPPY bit of code.

This is a DOS program, which was built with Microsoft C 7.0 for DOS. I don't
even know if it compiles under that environment anymore, but apparently there's
a binary here, too, which also may or may not work.

The language syntax is almost entirely LOGO, as the goal was to produce a free
implementation of LOGO, even before I understood the GNU definition of "free",
or that there were GPL'd LOGO packages available. At least this was a DOS one,
since nobody I knew could have used a Unix-based version at the time.  :)

Also, as far LOGOs go, this was just a tiny subset of the language.

History is always ugly.
