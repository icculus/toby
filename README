This is the original version of Toby. It was written for a senior high-school
exit project over the first couple months of 1995.

I wrote this in C, with very little understanding of the language; I was a
QuickBASIC 4.5 fan at the time. This is a CRAPPY bit of code.

This is a DOS program, which was built with Microsoft C 7.0 for DOS. I have
spent some effort reimplementing the Microsoft graphics library with SDL so
you can build this on modern systems, but the work isn't nearly complete, and
I didn't want to alter the original code too much, so you still get all the
fun memory corruptions and crashes. Subversion revision #3 is the unmolested
source as I found it several years ago...I think I probably patched it a
little after the end of the project, probably in a failed attempt to make it
a native, 16-bit OS/2 app, but I can't remember. Anything after revision #3
are just simple tweaks, more than a decade later, probably to reduce my shame.

The language syntax is almost entirely LOGO, as the goal was to produce a free
implementation of LOGO, even before I understood the GNU definition of "free",
or that there were GPL'd LOGO packages available. At least this was a DOS one,
since nobody I knew could have used a Unix-based version at the time.  :)

I hadn't conceived of designing my own programming language at this point. I
probably thought I wasn't allowed...not by the high school, just generally.

Also, as far LOGOs go, this was just a tiny subset of the language.

History is always ugly.
