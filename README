Documentation is in the docs/ directory. It's meager, but there are plans to
 greatly enhance the contents of this directory in the near future.

Quick start:

Compile the source into an executable file:

"make"

Run it:

"./toby"

Obviously, this is for Unix environments like Linux.

This program is licensed under the GNU General Public License. Please know
 your rights and freedoms; the license text can be found in docs/LICENSE.TXT;
 another copy is also in the root directory of the source tree, so you have
 ample opportunity to find it.  :)

Enjoy!
